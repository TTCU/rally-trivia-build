      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-heading text-center mb-8">Why We Built Rally Trivia</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-body leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We've all been to events that felt a little flat. The kind where guests check their phones, the energy dips after dinner, and the fundraising ask feels awkward. We knew there had to be a better way.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-body leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Trivia has a special power. It gets people laughing, talking, and competing together. It breaks the ice at corporate retreats and turns a quiet gala into the most talked-about night of the year. And when you weave giving into that energy, something remarkable happens — people are generous because they're having fun, not because they feel obligated.

      <blockquote class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary text-center my-12 px-8">
        "We make it easy for any organization to host amazing trivia events that bring people together and drive real results."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text-lg text-body leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Rally Trivia was born from that insight. We built a platform that handles all the complexity — the tech, the scoring, the question management — so event organizers can focus on what matters most: their guests and their mission. Whether you're raising money for a cause or building stronger teams at work, Rally Trivia gives you the tools to create an experience people actually remember.
