# Milestones

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-02-22)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases, 5 plans, 10 tasks
**Lines of code:** 1,196 (Astro/TS/CSS)
**Files changed:** 59

**Key accomplishments:**
- Astro 5 static site with Tailwind v4 brand tokens deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- Responsive layout shell with sticky glass-effect nav, SEO meta tags, and Motion scroll animations
- Conversion-oriented landing page with hero, value props, dual-audience cards, and social proof
- Features page with 12-card icon grid and About page with mission story
- Demo request form with blur validation, email typo detection, and animated thank-you confirmation

**Known Gaps:**
- Social proof stats are placeholders (500+ events, $2M+ raised, etc.) — replace with real data
- Contact form is UI-only — no backend wired (FORM-01 deferred to v2)
- Team section on About page uses placeholder names
