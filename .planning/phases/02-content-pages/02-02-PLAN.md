Purpose: These secondary pages deepen visitor understanding of Rally Trivia's platform and story, reinforcing the conversion path toward requesting a demo.
Output: `src/pages/features.astro` and `src/pages/about.astro` fully populated with marketing content and responsive layouts.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build features page with hero and feature card grid</name>
  <files>src/pages/features.astro</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder content in `src/pages/features.astro` with a complete features page:

**Frontmatter data:**
- Define a `features` array of 10-12 objects, each with `title` (string), `desc` (string), and `icon` (raw SVG string).
- Infer capabilities of a live trivia management platform: customizable trivia rounds, real-time scoring/leaderboards, audience participation via mobile, event branding/themes, analytics/reporting, team management, multimedia questions, live host tools, audience engagement metrics, custom question banks, scheduling/event management, integrations/embeds.
- Icons: Use inline SVG paths (Heroicons-style, MIT licensed). Each SVG: `class="w-7 h-7"`, `fill="none"`, `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, `stroke="currentColor"`, `stroke-width="2"`. Use distinct path shapes for each feature — clipboard, chart-bar, device-phone, paintbrush, presentation-chart, users, photo, microphone, sparkles, puzzle, calendar, link, etc.

**Section 1 — Hero:**
- Shorter hero for secondary page: `py-32 md:py-40 bg-navy px-4 animate-on-scroll` (NOT min-h-screen — reserve that for landing page per research recommendation)
- Inner container: `max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center`
- `h1`: `text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white leading-tight mb-6` — e.g., "Everything You Need to Run Amazing Trivia Events"
- Subtitle: `text-xl text-white/70 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-10`
- CTA button: `<a href="/contact">` with `bg-gold text-navy` styling

**Section 2 — Feature Grid (FEAT-01, FEAT-02):**
- Light section: `py-24 px-4 bg-white animate-on-scroll`
- Inner container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto`
- Optional section heading above the grid
- Responsive grid: `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-6`
- Each card: `bg-slate-50 rounded-brand p-6 border border-navy/5 hover:border-electric-blue/30 transition-colors`
- Icon: `<div class="text-electric-blue mb-4 w-8 h-8" set:html={icon} />`
- Title: `text-lg font-bold text-navy mb-2`
- Description: `text-navy/60 text-sm`

**Section 3 — Bottom CTA:**
- Dark section: `py-24 px-4 bg-navy animate-on-scroll`
- Centered heading + CTA button linking to /contact
- `bg-gold text-navy` button styling

Copy tone: warm, approachable, scannable. Short descriptions (1-2 sentences per feature).
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` — no errors. Dev server shows features page with hero, 10-12 feature cards in responsive grid, and bottom CTA. Check all SVG icons render correctly (no broken markup). Verify responsive: 1-col mobile, 2-col tablet, 3-4 col desktop.</verify>
  <done>Features page displays a hero, a responsive grid of 10-12 feature cards with inline SVG icons, and a bottom CTA — all with scroll animations and brand styling.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build about page with mission story and team placeholder</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder content in `src/pages/about.astro` with a complete about page:

**Frontmatter data:**
- Define a `team` array of 3-4 placeholder team members, each with `name` (use "[Founder Name]", "[Team Member]", etc.) and `title` (e.g., "Founder & CEO", "Head of Events", "Lead Developer")

**Section 1 — Hero:**
- Shorter hero: `py-32 md:py-40 bg-navy px-4 animate-on-scroll`
- Inner container: `max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center`
- `h1`: `text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white leading-tight mb-6` — e.g., "Making Every Event Unforgettable"
- Subtitle: `text-xl text-white/70 max-w-2xl mx-auto` — brief mission teaser

**Section 2 — Our Story / Mission (ABOU-01):**
- Light section: `py-24 px-4 bg-white animate-on-scroll`
- Inner container: `max-w-3xl mx-auto` (narrower for readability of prose)
- Section heading: `text-4xl font-bold text-navy text-center mb-8` — "Our Story" or "Why We Built Rally Trivia"
- 2-3 paragraphs of mission-driven copy: focus on WHY Rally Trivia exists — making fundraising fun and events memorable. Tone: warm, personal, conversational. Lead with the problem (events can be boring, fundraising feels transactional) → the insight (trivia brings people together) → the mission (we make it easy for any organization to host amazing trivia events)
- Use `text-lg text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6` for paragraph styling
- Optionally include a highlighted quote/mission statement: `text-2xl font-bold text-deep-blue text-center my-12 px-8` with a brief mission summary

**Section 3 — Team/Founder (ABOU-02):**
- Light background variation: `py-24 px-4 bg-slate-50 animate-on-scroll`
- Inner container: `max-w-5xl mx-auto`
- Section heading: `text-4xl font-bold text-navy text-center mb-4` — "Meet the Team"
- Subtitle: `text-navy/60 text-center mb-16` — "More to come — we're just getting started."
- Responsive grid: `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-10`
- Each team member card: centered layout with:
  - Placeholder avatar: `div` with `w-28 h-28 rounded-full bg-deep-blue/20 mb-4 flex items-center justify-center` containing an inline SVG user icon (NOT emoji — use a simple SVG person silhouette in `text-deep-blue/40`)
  - Name: `font-bold text-navy`
  - Title: `text-navy/60 text-sm`
- Add HTML comment noting placeholders should be replaced with real photos and names

**Section 4 — Bottom CTA:**
- Dark section: `py-24 px-4 bg-navy animate-on-scroll`
- Centered heading: something like "Ready to Create Your Next Great Event?"
- CTA button: `<a href="/contact">` with `bg-gold text-navy` styling

All sections must have `animate-on-scroll` class. Update the BaseLayout `description` prop to a proper SEO description for the about page.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` — no errors. Dev server shows about page with hero, mission story paragraphs, team placeholder grid with avatar circles, and bottom CTA. Verify responsive layouts and that placeholder team section is clearly marked for future content replacement.</verify>
  <done>About page tells the Rally Trivia story with mission-driven copy, displays a placeholder team section ready for real photos/names, and includes CTAs pointing to /contact.</done>
