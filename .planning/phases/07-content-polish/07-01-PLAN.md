  truths:
    - "About page team section displays 4 real team members: Amanda Flaherty, Davis Light, Jenna Davis, Joe Slitzker (in that order)"
    - "Each team member card shows a real photo in a rounded circle frame, not a placeholder avatar"
    - "Team photos load without layout shift (Astro Image component with explicit dimensions)"
    - "Each card shows the member's real name and title"
    - "No placeholder text remains anywhere on the About page"
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/pages/about.astro"
      provides: "Complete About page with real team data, photos, and LinkedIn links"
      contains: "import { Image } from 'astro:assets'"

<objective>
Replace all placeholder content in the About page team section with real founding team names, titles, photos, and LinkedIn links. Update the grid layout from 3-column to 4-column. Replace the placeholder subtitle with a mission-driven line. Review the entire About page for any remaining rough edges.

Purpose: The About page should feel complete and credible to any visitor — no placeholder text, no avatar silhouettes, no "coming soon" signals.
Output: Updated `src/pages/about.astro` with real team data and optimized photos.

  <name>Task 1: Replace placeholder team section with real data and photos</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
Update `src/pages/about.astro` with the following changes:

**Frontmatter imports:**
- Add `import { Image } from 'astro:assets';`
- Add ESM imports for each team photo:
  - `import amandaPhoto from '../../assets/images/amanda.jpeg';`
  - `import davisPhoto from '../../assets/images/davis.jpeg';`
  - `import jennaPhoto from '../../assets/images/jenna.jpeg';`
  - `import joePhoto from '../../assets/images/joe.jpeg';`

**Team data array — replace the placeholder array with:**
```typescript
const team = [
  { name: 'Amanda Flaherty', title: 'TTCU Cares Foundation Director', photo: amandaPhoto, linkedin: '#' },
  { name: 'Davis Light', title: 'IT Support Supervisor and Award Winning Trivia Night Host', photo: davisPhoto, linkedin: '#' },
  { name: 'Jenna Davis', title: 'IT Business Analyst and Chief Justice of the Trivia Judicial Panel', photo: jennaPhoto, linkedin: '#' },
  { name: 'Joe Slitzker', title: 'SVP of Technology & Innovation', photo: joePhoto, linkedin: '#' },
];
```
NOTE: LinkedIn URLs use `#` placeholders — real URLs to be provided by the user.

**Display order is intentional — Joe last. Do not reorder.**

**Team section subtitle:**
- Replace `"More to come — we're just getting started."` with a mission-driven line. Use Claude's discretion for wording (e.g., "The people behind the platform — building tools that bring communities together."). Keep it concise and on-brand.

**Grid layout:**
- Change `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` for 4-across on desktop.

**Team card markup — replace the placeholder avatar div with:**
- Astro `<Image>` component: `<Image src={photo} alt={name} width={160} height={160} class="rounded-full object-cover w-40 h-40 mb-4" />`
- Note: w-40/h-40 (10rem) is larger than current w-28/h-28 — Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md. Adjust if needed.

**Add subtle card treatment:**
- Wrap each card in a container with light background and subtle shadow: `class="flex flex-col items-center text-center p-6 rounded-xl bg-white shadow-sm"`

**Add LinkedIn icon to each card:**
- Below the title, add a small LinkedIn SVG icon wrapped in an anchor tag:
  ```html
  <a href={linkedin} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label={`${name} on LinkedIn`} class="mt-3 inline-block text-body-light hover:text-primary transition-colors">
    <svg class="w-5 h-5" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

  ```

**Remove placeholder comments:**
- Remove the `<!-- TODO: Replace placeholder names... -->` comment
- Remove the `<!-- Placeholder avatar — replace with <img>... -->` comment

**Full About page review:**
- Scan the entire page for any remaining placeholder text, TODO comments, or rough edges.
- The `[Founder Name]` and `[Team Member]` placeholders in the old array are the primary targets — ensure they are completely gone.

Run `npm run build` — build must succeed with no errors. Then check the built output:
- `grep -r "Founder Name" dist/` should return nothing
- `grep -r "Team Member" dist/` should return nothing
- `grep -r "just getting started" dist/` should return nothing
- `grep -r "TODO" src/pages/about.astro` should return nothing
- `grep "astro:assets" src/pages/about.astro` should confirm Image import
  </verify>
  <done>
About page team section shows 4 real team members with names, titles, photos (via Astro Image), and LinkedIn icon links. No placeholder text or TODO comments remain. Build succeeds.

  <name>Task 2: Visual verification of About page team section</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
Start the dev server and visually verify the About page team section. This is a human verification checkpoint — no code changes.

What was built: Complete About page with real team photos, names, titles, LinkedIn icons, updated subtitle, and 4-column responsive grid layout. Placeholder content has been fully replaced.

How to verify:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:4321/about
3. Scroll to "Meet the Team" section
4. Verify:
   - 4 team members displayed in order: Amanda, Davis, Jenna, Joe
   - Each has a real photo in a rounded circle frame (not a placeholder avatar)
   - Names and titles are correct and match CONTEXT.md
   - Subtitle is mission-driven (no longer says "just getting started")
   - LinkedIn icons are visible below each title
   - Cards have subtle background/shadow treatment
5. Resize browser to check responsive behavior:
   - Desktop (lg+): 4 cards across
   - Tablet (sm-lg): 2 cards per row
   - Mobile: 1 card per row, stacked
6. Check that photos load without visible layout shift (no content jumping)
7. Scroll through the entire About page — no placeholder text or rough edges anywhere
  </action>
  <verify>User confirms visual appearance is correct by typing "approved"</verify>
  <done>User has approved the visual appearance of the About page team section</done>
