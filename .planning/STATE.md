# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Visitors understand what Rally Trivia does and request a demo — every page funnels toward that conversion.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Current Position

Milestone v1.0 MVP shipped 2026-02-22.
All 3 phases (5 plans) complete.
Next: `/gsd:new-milestone` to start v1.1.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Social proof uses placeholder stats — replace with real data when available
- Contact form UI only — no backend wired yet (deferred per project decision)
