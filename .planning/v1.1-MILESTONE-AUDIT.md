# Milestone v1.1 Audit: Production Polish

**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 2/8 requirements satisfied (FORM-02, FORM-04 partial)

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Plans | Requirements |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 4. Worker Foundation | Complete | 2/2 | FORM-02 (partial), FORM-04 (partial) |
| 5. Form Backend | Not started | 0/? | FORM-01, FORM-03 |
| 6. Analytics | Not started | 0/? | ANLX-01, ANLX-02 |
| 7. Content Polish | Not started | 0/? | TEAM-01, TEAM-02 |

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| FORM-01 | 5 | unsatisfied | Phase not started |
| FORM-02 | 4 | partial | Worker stub works, no verification file |
| FORM-03 | 5 | unsatisfied | Phase not started |
| FORM-04 | 4 | partial | Secret stored per user confirmation, no verification file |
| ANLX-01 | 6 | unsatisfied | Phase not started |
| ANLX-02 | 6 | unsatisfied | Phase not started |
| TEAM-01 | 7 | unsatisfied | Phase not started |
| TEAM-02 | 7 | unsatisfied | Phase not started |

## Integration Findings

### Broken Flow: Contact Form Submission

The end-to-end flow (form submit → Worker → Resend → email delivery → success UI) is not wired. `ContactForm.astro` uses a hardcoded `setTimeout(1500)` instead of `fetch('/api/contact')`. The Worker stub exists and responds correctly but has no caller. This is expected — Phase 5 closes this gap.

### Low-Severity Issues

1. `worker-configuration.d.ts` does not include `RESEND_API_KEY` — expected for Wrangler secrets, handled by inline `Env` interface
2. `src/worker/tsconfig.json` uses file path in `types[]` — works but non-standard

## Tech Debt

- Phase 4: No VERIFICATION.md (verifier disabled in config)
- Phase 4: Worker tsconfig uses relative path in types field

## Summary

Phase 4 delivered a solid Worker foundation: routing, stub endpoint, secrets, DNS verification. But the milestone is 1/4 phases complete with 6/8 requirements unsatisfied. Phases 5-7 must be planned and executed to close the milestone.
